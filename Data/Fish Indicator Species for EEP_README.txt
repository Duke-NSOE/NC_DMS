This Excel spreadsheet contains three worksheets. 

The MASTER worksheet lists the indicator aquatic species to model as suggested by Bryn Tracy (Bryn.Tracy@ncdenr.gov) of the NC Department of Natural Resources.  Species are grouped into the major ecoregions in NC in which it should represent and are identified by their common name. 

The remaining worksheets are the subset of aquatic species listed for their respective ecoregion (e.g. Piedmont, MACP) and include both the common and scientific name for each species. The scientific name is written in a format to correspond to column names in the SpeciesOccurrence feature class (i.e. with an underscore between the genus and species name). 

These ecoregion specific worksheets are used to generate lists of species used in the DMS uplift analysis. Care should be taken to keep scientific names in their specific format.
